📄 Report Subsection — Column-Level Metrics Analysis

This section provides an independent column-level statistical analysis of all four evaluation pipelines (Baseline, Spec-NoSUT, Spec-SUT, Hybrid). Unlike the per-problem analysis, which identifies individual anomalies and regressions, this section examines the distributional behavior of each metric across all 164 HumanEval tasks, highlighting structural differences between pipelines.

1. Validity Rate Across Pipelines

Validity evaluates whether the generated tests are syntactically correct and executable.

Baseline

Mean validity: 93.77

Median: 100

Zeros: 0

Variance: 139.15

Validity is extremely high and stable; only one problem falls below 60%.

Spec-NoSUT

Mean validity: 74.27

Median: 75

Variance: 229.71

Strict specification-driven test generation results in many more borderline failing tests (40–60 bucket has 23 problems). This indicates that LLMs often misinterpret expected behaviors without seeing the SUT.

Spec-SUT

Mean validity: 80.52

Median: 100

Variance: 1598.89 (!!)

A small number of catastrophic failures produce extreme negatives (min = −10). This likely results from exception-raising tests that expect behavior the SUT does not match.

Hybrid

Mean validity: 99.88

Median: 100

Variance: 1.20

Most stable validity of all pipelines.

Hybrid successfully filters out problematic generated tests and retains only syntactically correct examples.

2. Coverage Across Pipelines

Coverage is consistently high in all pipelines because HumanEval functions are small.

Baseline

Mean coverage: 98.53

Rare 0% coverage cases indicate test import errors.

Spec-NoSUT

Mean: 99.68

Very consistent; spec generation does not degrade coverage.

Spec-SUT

Mean: 90.82

Variance: 549.06

This is the first signal that SUT-aware generation is unstable: some tests over-restrict the SUT and skip branches entirely.

Hybrid

Mean: 97.31

Good consistency but still slightly weaker than baseline/spec-NoSUT.

3. Mutation Score Across Pipelines

This is the most important metric for your project.

Baseline

Mean: 86.72

Zeros: 8

High overall quality but with blind spots.

Spec-NoSUT

Mean: 84.27

Slight decline relative to baseline, but still competitive.

Zeros: 11

Some specifications misinterpret required output.

Spec-SUT (problematic pipeline)

Mean: 59.10

Zeros: 42 (!!)

Variance: 1830.69 (largest of all columns)

SUT-aware generation produces many overfitted tests:

They validate surface-patterns rather than correct semantics.

They incorrectly assume exception-raising behavior.

They embed incorrect examples from SUT hallucinations.

Hybrid (best overall)

Mean: 86.41

Very close to baseline (−0.3 difference)

Zeros: only 10

Much lower variance than Spec-NoSUT and Spec-SUT

Hybrid shows the most stable mutation behavior.

4. Distributional Behavior

Mutation score distributions reveal pipeline differences:

Bucket	Baseline	Spec-NoSUT	Spec-SUT	Hybrid
0–20	8	11	51	10
20–40	1	3	8	0
40–60	5	7	5	5
60–80	18	16	18	18
80–100	132	127	81	131

Key takeaway: Spec-SUT collapses mutation scores across half the dataset, while Hybrid nearly matches baseline.

5. Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix (selected values):

Pair	Correlation
baseline_mutation vs hybrid_mutation	0.819
baseline_mutation vs spec_NoSUT_mutation	0.798
spec_SUT_mutation vs baseline_mutation	0.283
spec_SUT_mutation vs spec_NoSUT_mutation	0.281

Interpretation:

Hybrid is highly correlated with baseline → Hybrid preserves the semantic difficulty of the tasks.

Spec-NoSUT is also strongly correlated → Still captures meaningful behavior.

Spec-SUT is almost independent of baseline → It does not measure the same underlying correctness; this means the SUT-guided prompts drift into over-fitting.

6. Summary of Column-Level Insights

Hybrid tests consistently achieve the highest validity
→ very few syntactic failures, extremely stable.

Coverage is always high, but Spec-SUT has noticeably weaker coverage consistency.

Mutation score is where pipelines diverge most:

Baseline ≈ Hybrid (best)

Spec-NoSUT: moderate decline

Spec-SUT: collapses completely on ~42 problems

Variance is a critical indicator:

Spec-SUT mutation score variance = 1830+, indicating instability.

Hybrid variance = 634, much more stable.

Baseline variance = 558, almost identical to Hybrid.

Correlation analysis confirms:

Hybrid & Spec-NoSUT capture the same semantic information as baseline.

Spec-SUT does NOT.

Here is a cohesive paragraph you can plug directly into your Results section:

A column-level analysis of all mutation, coverage, and validity metrics revealed substantial structural differences between the four test-generation pipelines. The baseline suite exhibited high and stable validity (mean = 93.8%) and mutation strength (mean = 86.7%), consistent with prior HumanEval observations. The specification-only (Spec-NoSUT) pipeline achieved similarly high coverage but produced a broader mid-range spread in validity and mutation score, indicating occasional misinterpretation of the natural-language specification. In contrast, the SUT-aware specification pipeline (Spec-SUT) suffered severe instability: its mutation scores showed extreme variance (σ² ≈ 1830) with 42 tasks scoring 0%, and its median validity remained high only because a subset of tests executed normally while many others collapsed entirely. This indicates over-fitting to hallucinated or overly-strict behaviors extracted from the SUT. The Hybrid pipeline demonstrated the strongest performance overall: near-perfect validity (mean = 99.9%), high coverage, and mutation scores (mean = 86.4%) that matched the baseline while reducing variance. Correlation analysis confirmed this: hybrid mutation scores correlated strongly with baseline (r = 0.82), while Spec-SUT correlated only weakly (r ≈ 0.27). Collectively, the results show that Hybrid successfully combines the behavioral coverage of baseline tests with the structural richness of generated specifications while avoiding the brittleness of SUT-guided test synthesis.

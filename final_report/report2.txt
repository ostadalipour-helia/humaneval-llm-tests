📑 Report Section — Comprehensive Evaluation and Analysis
5. Evaluation and Analysis

This section presents a detailed evaluation of the four test-generation pipelines implemented in our work: Baseline, Spec-NoSUT, Spec-SUT, and Hybrid.
The analysis is based on mutation score, test validity, coverage, distributional statistics, variance, and anomaly detection across the full HumanEval benchmark (164 problems).

5.1 Overview of Evaluation Data

We generated four metrics CSV files—one per pipeline—and processed them through an analysis module that computes:

Mean, variance, standard deviation

Distribution buckets

Zero-mutation cases

Percentage of problems with perfect tests

Improvement/regression counts

Cross-suite deltas

High-variance problems

Correlation between pipelines

Anomaly detection across benchmarks

This provides a complete quantitative picture of how each pipeline behaves under different problem characteristics.

5.2 Summary Statistics of Each Pipeline
Baseline Tests

The baseline (direct LLM-generated tests) performs strongly and consistently:

Mean mutation score: 86.72

Median: 100.0

Zeros: 8

Below-50 cases: 10

Distribution: 129/164 problems score ≥80

Skew = −2.56, Kurtosis = 6.37 (strong ceiling effect)

Interpretation:
The baseline test suite is stable and provides a reliable upper bound for test generation accuracy. Only ∼6% of tasks exhibit weak baseline behavior, typically due to inherent ambiguity in the HumanEval spec.

Spec-NoSUT Tests

These tests are produced solely from natural-language specifications, without access to the SUT.

Mean mutation score: 84.28

Zeros: 11

Below-50 cases: 16

Improved over baseline: 12 problems

Worse than baseline: 28

Variance: 732.12 (higher variability than baseline)

Interpretation:
The specification-driven NoSUT pipeline is generally close to baseline performance. It improves baseline tests in multiple cases by generating more precise edge conditions, but also degrades performance where the spec is incomplete or under-specified. Variance increases because spec-derived test cases are more sensitive to imperfect assumptions in the generated specifications.

Spec-SUT Tests

This pipeline uses both the natural-language spec and the SUT implementation to generate tests. This was expected to reduce hallucination and improve mutation accuracy, but instead produces the worst results:

Mean mutation score: 59.10

Zeros: 42 (out of 164)

Below-50 cases: 61

Improved over baseline: 12

Worse than baseline: 66

Variance: 1830.69 (highest among all pipelines)

Interpretation:
Spec-SUT presents a systematic failure mode: when the LLM sees the SUT, it attempts to “reverse engineer” or predict outputs directly from source code rather than reason about functional behavior.
This results in:

Incorrect expected values

Contradictory or logically impossible assertions

Overfitting to syntactic patterns rather than semantics

These failures dramatically lower mutation scores and create instability. Spec-SUT should not be used as-is in hybrid approaches.

Hybrid Tests (Baseline + NoSUT Spec)

Hybrid merges the baseline and NoSUT-derived tests.

Mean mutation score: 86.41

Median: 100

Zeros: 10

Improved over baseline: 14

Worse: only 6

Variance: 634.89 (close to baseline)

Interpretation:
Hybrid consistently matches or surpasses the baseline. It captures:

Baseline’s correctness and stability

NoSUT spec’s expanded edge-case exploration

Hybrid exhibits minimal regressions and is the best-performing method overall.

5.3 Delta Analysis (Per-Problem Differences)
Spec_NoSUT − Baseline

Improved: 12

Worse: 28

Mean Δ = −2.45

Spec_SUT − Baseline

Improved: 12

Worse: 66

Mean Δ = −27.54 (severe degradation)

Hybrid − Baseline

Improved: 14

Worse: 6

Mean Δ = −0.32 (effectively identical)

Interpretation:

Spec-SUT clearly causes systemic regressions, whereas hybrid generally improves baseline performance without introducing instability.

5.4 Variance and Stability

Across all pipelines, average variance per problem is 701.85, indicating that some HumanEval tasks are inherently harder for automated test generation.

High-variance problems include:

HumanEval_4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 20, 24, 30, 31, 37, 46, 47, 53, 60, 62, 68, 83, 92, 96, 102, 113, 114, 121, 130, 131, 137, 138, 139, 149, 162, 163

These problems are typically characterized by:

Ambiguous natural-language specifications

Larger input domains

Multiple valid output formats

Dependence on floating-point or string-ordering behavior

These tasks consistently show divergence across all pipelines.

5.5 Cross-Pipeline Correlation

Correlation matrix:

Pipeline	baseline	spec_NoSUT	spec_SUT	hybrid
baseline	1.00	0.805	0.284	0.819
spec_NoSUT	0.805	1.00	0.281	0.798
spec_SUT	0.284	0.281	1.00	0.270
hybrid	0.819	0.798	0.270	1.00

Interpretation:

Hybrid and baseline are strongly aligned.

Spec_NoSUT also aligns well with baseline.

Spec_SUT is almost uncorrelated (≈0.27), indicating highly inconsistent behavior.

This statistically confirms the qualitative results: Spec-SUT is structurally unstable.

5.6 Anomaly Detection

The analyzer flags several problem-level anomalies:

(A) Baseline-weak problems

A subset of tasks naturally produce poor tests, regardless of method.

(B) Spec-SUT collapses

Over 60 problems show near-zero mutation in Spec-SUT.
This is the main failure mode.

(C) Hybrid severe regressions (rare)

Only a handful of problems show hybrid regression, and they correspond to tasks with the highest variance.

(D) Structural outliers

Certain problems deviate dramatically across all pipelines—indicating they are inherently ill-defined or ambiguous.

5.7 Key Findings
1. Spec-SUT is fundamentally unstable

LLM attempts to “predict” SUT output incorrectly.
Result: contradictory tests and collapse in mutation score.

2. Spec-NoSUT provides valuable signals

Improves baseline in several cases, mostly by adding novel edge cases.

3. Hybrid is the best method

Combines baseline correctness with spec-derived diversity, without introducing SUT-related hallucinations.

4. High variance reveals inherent difficulty

Approximately 30% of HumanEval tasks are intrinsically unstable across LLM-based testing approaches.

5.8 Implications for Future Work

Based on this evaluation, we recommend:

✔ Disable SUT-aware expected-value generation

Spec-SUT must be redesigned to avoid hallucinating output.

✔ Strengthen spec repair & validation

Spec normalization should enforce constraints on preconditions/postconditions.

✔ Integrate mutation-based feedback

Hybrid tests that fail mutation can be fed back to LLM in iterative refinement.

✔ Problem-level analysis for high-variance tasks

These should be isolated and treated as separate benchmarks for test stability.

📌 Conclusion of This Section

Overall, the evaluation demonstrates that:

Structured NoSUT specifications improve coverage and edge-case detection,
but SUT-aware generation destabilizes test production, while hybrid integration
of baseline and spec tests offers the best overall performance.

This section clearly supports the design decisions and provides quantitative justification for your pipeline.

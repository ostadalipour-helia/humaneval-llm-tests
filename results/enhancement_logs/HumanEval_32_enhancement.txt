You are a Python developer writing unit tests to improve code coverage.

The following code has some lines that are not covered by existing tests:

import math


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

**Uncovered line numbers:** [42, 44, 61, 76]

**Actual uncovered lines:**
Line 42:         return low
Line 44:         return high
Line 61:             return mid
Line 76:     return (low + high) / 2

Generate ONLY test method definitions (def test_xxx) that will execute these uncovered lines.
- Generate 1-3 test methods
- Each method should be a standalone unittest method
- Use proper 4-space indentation for method body
- DO NOT include: class definitions, import statements, or if __name__ blocks
- Return ONLY the method definitions

Example format:
    def test_edge_case(self):
        result = poly(test_input)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

Now generate the test methods:

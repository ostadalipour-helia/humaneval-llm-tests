You are a Python developer writing unit tests to improve code coverage.

The following code has some lines that are not covered by existing tests:

def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split the encoded string into groups. Each of length 3.
    # This splitting logic is identical to encode_cyclic as the group sizes are preserved.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]

    # Reverse the cycling for each group.
    # If a group had 3 elements, it was cycled from 'abc' to 'bca'.
    # To reverse 'bca' back to 'abc', we move the last character ('a') to the front.
    # If a group had fewer than 3 elements, it was not cycled, so it remains unchanged.
    decoded_groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]

    # Join the decoded groups back into a single string.
    return "".join(decoded_groups)

**Uncovered line numbers:** [6, 8, 9]

**Actual uncovered lines:**
Line 6:     groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
Line 8:     groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
Line 9:     return "".join(groups)

Generate ONLY test method definitions (def test_xxx) that will execute these uncovered lines.
- Generate 1-3 test methods
- Each method should be a standalone unittest method
- Use proper 4-space indentation for method body
- DO NOT include: class definitions, import statements, or if __name__ blocks
- Return ONLY the method definitions

Example format:
    def test_edge_case(self):
        result = encode_cyclic(test_input)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

Now generate the test methods:

RESPONSE
================================================================================
def test_encode_cyclic_single_char(self):
        # This test case uses a single-character string.
        # - Line 6 (group splitting) will create a single group ["a"].
        # - Line 8 (group cycling) will find that len("a") is not 3,
        #   thus executing the 'else group' branch.
        # - Line 9 (joining groups) will execute as the function returns.
        s = "a"
        expected = "a"
        result = encode_cyclic(s)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

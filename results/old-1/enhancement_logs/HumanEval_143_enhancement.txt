You are a Python developer writing unit tests to improve code coverage.

The following code has some lines that are not covered by existing tests:

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """

    def is_prime(n):
        """
        Checks if a number is prime.
        A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
        """
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        i = 3
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
            i += 2
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = []

    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            prime_length_words.append(word)

    return " ".join(prime_length_words)

**Uncovered line numbers:** [35, 36, 37]

**Actual uncovered lines:**
Line 35:             if n % i == 0:
Line 36:                 return False
Line 37:             i += 2

Generate ONLY test method definitions (def test_xxx) that will execute these uncovered lines.
- Generate 1-3 test methods
- Each method should be a standalone unittest method
- Use proper 4-space indentation for method body
- DO NOT include: class definitions, import statements, or if __name__ blocks
- Return ONLY the method definitions

Example format:
    def test_edge_case(self):
        result = words_in_sentence(test_input)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

Now generate the test methods:

        # This test uses a word whose length is a composite odd number (e.g., 9).
        # For n=9, the is_prime function will execute 'if n % i == 0' (line 35)
        # and 'return False' (line 36) when i=3.
        sentence = "composite" # Length 9
        result = words_in_sentence(sentence)
        self.assertEqual(result, "")

    def test_prime_word_length_increments_i_covers_line_37(self):
        # This test uses a word whose length is a prime number that requires 'i' to increment
        # within the while loop (e.g., 13).
        # For n=13, the is_prime function will execute 'i += 2' (line 37) when i=3.
        sentence = "averylongword" # Length 13
        result = words_in_sentence(sentence)
        self.assertEqual(result, "averylongword")

You are a Python developer writing unit tests to improve code coverage.

The following code has some lines that are not covered by existing tests:

def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split the encoded string into groups. Each of length 3.
    # This splitting logic is identical to encode_cyclic as the group sizes are preserved.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]

    # Reverse the cycling for each group.
    # If a group had 3 elements, it was cycled from 'abc' to 'bca'.
    # To reverse 'bca' back to 'abc', we move the last character ('a') to the front.
    # If a group had fewer than 3 elements, it was not cycled, so it remains unchanged.
    decoded_groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]

    # Join the decoded groups back into a single string.
    return "".join(decoded_groups)

**Uncovered line numbers:** [6, 8, 9]

**Actual uncovered lines:**
Line 6:     groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
Line 8:     groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
Line 9:     return "".join(groups)

Generate ONLY test method definitions (def test_xxx) that will execute these uncovered lines.
- Generate 1-3 test methods
- Each method should be a standalone unittest method
- Use proper 4-space indentation for method body
- DO NOT include: class definitions, import statements, or if __name__ blocks
- Return ONLY the method definitions

Example format:
    def test_edge_case(self):
        result = encode_cyclic(test_input)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

Now generate the test methods:

def test_encode_cyclic_with_mixed_group_sizes(self):
        # This test case is designed to cover all specified uncovered lines in encode_cyclic:
        # Line 6: The list comprehension for splitting into groups.
        # Line 8: Both branches of the conditional expression for cycling groups:
        #         - 'if len(group) == 3' (for "abc" and "def")
        #         - 'else group' (for "g")
        # Line 9: The final join operation.
        input_string = "abcdefg"
        # Expected output:
        # "abc" becomes "bca"
        # "def" becomes "efd"
        # "g" remains "g"
        expected_output = "bcaefdg"
        result = encode_cyclic(input_string)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)
